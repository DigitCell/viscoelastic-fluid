# Particle-based Viscoelastic Fluid Simulation Implementation

This project is an implementation of the paper Particle-based Viscoelastic Fluid Simulation by Simon Clavet, Philippe Beaudoin, and Pierre Poulin.

## About:

This repository contains a TypeScript version of the original JavaScript implementation found here.
https://github.com/kotsoft/particle_based_viscoelastic_fluid



## [**Demo**](https://digitcell.github.io/viscoelastic-fluid/) 

### Features

- **Interactive Fluid Simulation:** Use the mouse to interact with and move the fluid. 
- **Rendering Modes:** Switch between canvas and SVG rendering for different visual experiences. 

### How to Use

1. **Mouse Interaction:**   - Click and drag your mouse over the simulation area to interact with the fluid. This will allow you to move and manipulate the fluid particles dynamically. 

2.  **Switching Rendering Modes:**   - The simulation provides options to render the fluid using either the canvas or SVG. You can switch between these rendering modes using the provided controls in the demo interface.
